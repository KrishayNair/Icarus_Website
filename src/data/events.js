Each player chooses one of the Programs to play and is given four INSTRUCTION cards (one of each) Shuffle the Grid cards and set the cards up as shown on the right. The Programs should all face in aclockwise direction (the arrow above the Program’s head determines the direction it is facing) By default there are 60 Grid cards included in the game but only 56 are required. Place the 4 spare Grid cards to one side (they are not needed) If a player finds all of their paths blocked by Walls or other obstacles then at the start of their turn they can nominate an obstacle to be removed. They then have their turn as normal After the player has had their turn, they keep the Instruction card they showed and the next player has their turn (players should always have thefour Instruction cards to choose from).
